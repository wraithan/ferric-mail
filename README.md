# Ferric Mail

This is an attempt to build an SMTP server in rust. It is not currently to be
taken seriously as a project to be used in place of more mature options. It is a
research project for me both in learning rust, and writing a mail server that I
might be able to use for some stuff.

## Usage

This currently does not depend on any libraries, you should be able to `rustc
main.rs` then `./main` and have it start running. Issues are welcome, pull
requests should be discussed in an issue first as this is an exploration project
for me and I'd rather build certain parts myself.

It does not have any config, everything is hardcoded. I hope to update this
section in the near future to make it more configurable.
